# Tinycon

A small library for manipulating the favicon, in particular adding alert bubbles and changing images. Tinycon gracefully falls back to a number in title approach for browers that don't support canvas or dynamic favicons.

## Documentation

Tinycon adds a single object to the global namespace and does not require initialisation. 

### Basic Usage

```javascript
Tinycon.setBubble(6);
```

### Options

Tinycon can take a range of options to customise the look

* width: the width of the alert bubble
* height: the height of the alert bubble
* font: a css string to use for the fontface (recommended to leave this)
* colour: the foreground font colour
* background: the alert bubble background colour
* fallback: should we fallback to a number in brackets for browsers that don't support canvas/dynamic favicons? Boolean, or use the string 'force' to ensure a title update even in supported browsers.
* abbreviate: should tinycon shrink large numbers such as 1000 to an abbreviated version (1k). Boolean, defaults to true

```javascript
Tinycon.setOptions({
	width: 7,
	height: 9,
	font: '10px arial',
	colour: '#ffffff',
	background: '#549A2F',
	fallback: true
});
```

### AMD support

Tinycon can also be used as an asynchronous module.

```javascript
require([
	'tinycon.js'
], function (T) {

	T.setOptions({
		width: 7,
		height: 9,
		font: '10px arial',
		colour: '#ffffff',
		background: '#549A2F',
		fallback: true
	});

	T.setBubble(7);

});
```

## Browser Support

Tinycon has been tested to work completely in the following browsers. Older versions may be supported, but haven't been tested:

* Chrome 15+
* Firefox 9+
* Opera 11+

Currently the library degrades to title update:

* Internet Explorer 9
* Safari 5
